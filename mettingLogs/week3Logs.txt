        System architecture.

        Who did what:
        Denis: Explained the sketches he had drawn, explained the concept of architecture.
        Mingde: Talked about the high-fidelity wireframe.
        Diwen: Improved the sketch based on Denisâ€™s, shwoed the N-tier to others and some tech stack behind it.


Date: Tue 7 Oct
    Time: 8:30 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:40 (with mentor), 10:40 to 11:23

        What did we talking about:
        High-fidelity wireframes, technical architecture, requirements on the GitHub, TO DO FOR THIS WEEK.

        Who did what:
        Denis: Explained his version of technical architecture, reviewed the high-fidelity wireframes, did some researches.
               Explained to the mentor what we had done over the last few days and asked mentor about the GitHub requirements for his part.
        Mingde: Showed us the high-fidelity wireframes he drawn on the Figma, snet a YouTube link of the Event-driven architecture.
        Diwen: Explain what should be improved in the high-fidelity wireframes. Ask questions to the mentor to choose project directions such as Redis and EDA.
               Confirmed what needs to be done today.
