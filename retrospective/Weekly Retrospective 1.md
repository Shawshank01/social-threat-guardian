# Social Threat Guardian – Weekly Retrospective 1
## **Regular Schedule:** Every Sunday before 18:00

**Team Name:** Zero cool  
**Team member** Diwen Xiao, Denis Muriuki, Mingde Zhou  
**Period Covered:** Sun 28 Sep – Sun 12 Oct

## **Overview**
This first retrospective covers the initial two weeks of work on the *Social Threat Guardian* project. During this period, the team transitioned from defining requirement specifications and user personas and sketches to developing low and high-fidelity wireframes, drafting N-Tier system architecture, and conducting early project planning. The team focused on clarifying application logic, coordinating design integration, collecting survey feedback, creating the frontend demo, and ensuring that technical and ethical considerations were aligned with GDPR.

## **What Went Well**
- **Conceptual Clarity:** The team clearly defined the overall application logic early on, which helped align understanding of the project’s objectives.  
- **Collaboration:** The team maintained regular communication between members, connecting the wireframes with sketches and use cases effectively. We also use online editing platform like Figma and Draw.io to draw diagrams online and review each others works.
- **Organisation:** Improvements were introduced to the GitHub Projects workflow, including new columns and clearer task assignments, which made collaboration smoother.  
- **Technical Progress:** The team created the first prototype sketch, contributed to the high-fidelity design, outlined the N-tier system architecture for later development, and developed the frontend demo. 
- **Survey & Prototype:** The team designed and distributed the first project survey, gathered early feedback, and demonstrated the initial front-end prototype.

## **Challenges / What Could Be Improved**
- **Time Management:** Several meetings ran longer than planned, and there were too many meetings overall.  
- **Workload Balance:** Much time was spent on coordination and documentation, leaving less room for deeper technical work during the first sprint.  
- **Dependency Overlap:** Progress on sketches and wireframes occasionally depended on feedback loops between teammates, which slowed iteration and meant redrawing
  and resketching.  
- **Limited Backend Progress:** Most work focused on design and planning, with little technical foundation established yet for the backend or NLP components.  
- **Communication Barrier:** Sometimes communication has diffcuities when talking about some professional technologies and abstract designs, which cause some block in the meeting.

## **Lessons Learned**
- Early communication of system logic prevents design misalignment later.
- Proper communication and translation of each aspect of the project will actually save time and some work will get done.  
- Effective use of GitHub Projects can substantially improve team coordination, but it needs consistent updates and automation to fully support SCRUM workflows.  
- A good design can can reduce lots of future works or iteration we must do as much as research before we start coding.
- There are many kinds of users, so we need to produce personas for them, and also do a survey for those people to test their willings to use ur product, and know their pain points and wishes, which is good for design functional requirements and non-functional requirements.

## **Next Steps**
- Set up Gantt chart, automated milestones, roadmaps, and sprint tracking in GitHub Projects.  
- Begin developing a basic backend structure aligned with the N-tier architecture.  
- Continue refining the front-end prototype, integrating user feedback from the survey.  
- Maintain shorter, goal-driven meetings and improve timeboxing for future retrospectives.  
- Finish interim report and interim presentation.

**Reflection:**  
These past two weeks have laid the groundwork for *Social Threat Guardian*. Although much of the time was spent aligning the design, personas, and communications, the groundwork is now in place for stronger technical execution in the next phase. Moving forward, the team will continue to focus on front-end development, backend preparation, and efficient communication.
