# Social Threat Guardian – Weekly Retrospective 1
## **Regular Schedule:** Every Sunday before 18:00


**Author:** Diwen Xiao  
**Period Covered:** Sun 28 Sep – Sun 12 Oct

## **Overview**
This first retrospective covers the initial two weeks of work on the *Social Threat Guardian* project. During this period, the team transitioned from defining user personas and sketches to developing low and high-fidelity wireframes, drafting system architecture, and conducting early project planning. My focus was primarily on clarifying application logic, coordinating design integration, collecting survey feedbacks, creating the frontend demo and ensuring that technical and ethical considerations were aligned with GDPR.

---

## **What Went Well**
- **Conceptual Clarity:** I clearly presented the overall application logic to the team early on, which helped align our understanding of the project’s objectives.
- **Collaboration:** Collaboration: I maintained regular communication with Denis and Mingde, helping to connect the wireframes with my sketches and use case.
- **Organisation:** I introduced improvements to our GitHub Projects workflow, including new columns and clearer task assignments, making collaboration smoother.
- **Technical Progress:** I created the first prototype sketch, contributed to the high-fidelity design, outlined the N-tier system architecture for later development and developed the frontend demo.
- **Survey & Prototype:** I designed and distributed the first project survey, gathered early feedback, and demonstrated the initial front-end prototype.

---

## **Challenges / What Could Be Improved**
- **Time Management:** Several meetings ran longer than planned, too many meetings.
- **Workload Balance:** My time was heavily spent on coordination and documentation, leaving less room for deeper technical work during the first sprint.
- **Dependency Overlap:** Progress on sketches and wireframes occasionally depended on feedback loops between teammates, which slowed down iteration.
- **Limited Backend Progress:** Most work focused on design and planning, with little technical foundation established yet for the backend or NLP components.

---

## **Lessons Learned**
- Early communication of system logic prevents design misalignment later.
- Effective use of GitHub Projects can substantially improve team coordination, but it needs consistent updates and automation to fully support SCRUM workflows.

---

## **Next Steps**
- Set up Gantt chart, automated milestones, roadmaps, and sprint tracking in GitHub Projects.
- Begin developing a basic backend structure aligned with the N-tier architecture.
- Continue refining the front-end prototype, integrating user feedback from the survey.
- Maintain shorter, goal-driven meetings and improve timeboxing for future retrospectives.

**Reflection:**  
These past two weeks have laid the groundwork for Social Threat Guardian. Although much of the time was spent aligning the design, personas and communications, the groundwork is now in place for stronger technical execution in the next phase. Moving forward, I will continue to focus on front-end development and efficient communication.

## **Overview**
In the first two week of our project, out team has done lots of works: User requirement specifications, user personas, software archetecture, questionare, use case diagram, and low and high fidility wireframe. For me, I did user personas, low and high fidility wireframe andrequirement specifications and so on.

## **What Went Well**
- ## **Collaboration**
  The teams collaboration is going well, we hold meetings everyday to discuss the design of the prototype and research the technology, and also distribute future workload for everyone.
- ## **Github project management**
  Each person has a unique branch to work, after finishing their own part, they will push the changes to main branch, we review each other's work and merge it. Also we use Zenhub and Github project to manage the project. The backlog is used to manage the todo list.
- ## **Layout page overview**
  I created high fidility wireframe through discussion and sketches with my teammates, the page also will be designed as responsible design to fit smartphone size.
- ## **N-tier arhcitecture**
  Denis and I designed an N-tier architecture, and we draw the diagram for each component in the system.

## **Challenges / What Could Be Improved**
- ## **Research on Deep Learning**
  Don't have any experience on deep learning, needs more effort on it for the future development.
- ## **Communication with teammates is not smooth**
  Sometimes don't get teammate's intention, so it cost some mistake on my work.


---


## **What I learned**
- ## **A good design can reduce lots of future works or iteration**
  The design of architecture and tach stack must be accurate, we must do as much as research before we start coding.
- ## **Know what kind of people will use your product is important**
  There are many kinds of users, so we need to produce personas for them, and also do a survey for those people to test their willings to use ur product, and know their pain points and wishes, which is good for design functional requirements and non-functional requirements.



---


## **Future works**
- Improve software architecture, and spilt logic tier and presentation tier.
- For me personally, I will develop some key functions about logic tier, like webpush and some communication logic between DL tier and presentation tier.
- Have shorter meetings and enhance communications with teammates, improve collaboration with teammates.
- Finish interim report and interim presentation.
