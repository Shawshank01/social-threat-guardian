# Social Threat Guardian

## Background
Freedom of speech advocates often face targeted threats and harassment on social media platforms, such harassment may even escalate to physical assault or assassination attempts during on-site activities. These threats can be subtle or overt, making it challenging to monitor and respond effectively. An AI-powered system that detects and monitors such social media threats can provide valuable support to these advocates by alerting them to potential risks and enabling timely intervention.

## Objectives
- Develop an AI-driven system to detect social media threats against freedom of speech advocates.
- Utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze text-based threats.
- Incorporate visualization tools to monitor threat trends and patterns.
- Provide real-time alerts and comprehensive reports to users.

## Technical Approach
1. **Data Collection**
   - Gather social media data from platforms such as Reddit, Bluesky, Mastodon, Facebook, and Instagram using their APIs.
   - Focus on posts, comments, and messages directed at or mentioning freedom of speech advocates.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Clean and normalize text data.
   - Remove spam and irrelevant content.
   - Annotate data for supervised learning.

3. **Threat Detection using NLP**
   - Implement text classification models to identify threatening language.
   - Use sentiment analysis and entity recognition to understand context.
   - Apply pre-trained or prompt-based NLP models on labeled datasets to ensure accuracy and reliability.

4. **Visualization Tools**
   - Develop dashboards to display threat levels, sources, and trends.
   - Use charts and graphs to represent data insights clearly.

5. **Alert System**
   - Set up real-time notifications for detected threats.
   - Allow users to customize alert preferences.

## Expected Outcomes
- A functional AI system capable of detecting and monitoring social media threats.
- Enhanced safety and awareness for freedom of speech advocates.
- Data-driven insights into the nature and frequency of online threats.

## Optional Work May Apply to Future Use
- Expand to include multimedia threat detection (images, videos).
- Integrate with law enforcement and support organizations.
- Improve model robustness across different languages and cultures.
